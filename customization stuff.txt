If you want to modify this for your own custom palettes, you can just change the palette files in
assets/media/element-hair. The first line is reference colors, and the next 5 lines are for neutral,
heat, cold, shock, and wave. (Some files have 5 more lines; those are the five palettes for if you have
"hair+armor" selected instead of just hair. You can trim it down to just the normal ones if you want.)
You can check the psd files for easy gradient editing and to see it applied to the sprites as you go!

I've included boki-colors.zip as an example mod for if you don't want to overwrite this mod's files.
It replaces Lea's colors with Boki's from Copy Kitty, based on a few of the weapon palettes there. It 
also adds a little extra thing somewhere...


This system is pretty easy to extend for your own custom characters, or to palette-swap other things.
I included "xpc-elemental-hair-example.zip" which shows the code and assets needed for it.
It applies the elemental hair palette to Triblader-Lea in the XPC mod, and should be somewhat
self-explanatory. There's also a few different ways to make the recolor only apply conditionally,
only to certain characters or when certain conditions are met. Check the main function in
prestart.js for details.
