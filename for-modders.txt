This system is pretty easy to extend for your own custom characters, or to palette-swap other things.
You can look at the code at the bottom of postload.js to see the general format, and boki-colors.zip
for an example of how to make a standalone mod. All your additions should be in prestart.

A few small details:
- You can put your code in a "if (window.elementalhair)" block to only run if this is installed.
- It's possible to make a palette apply to only specific characters, which works for party members and
    such, automatically matching *their* element instead of yours.
- You can add arbitrary conditionals to make the recolors only apply under certain conditions, like
    while a certain buff is active, or if you get a certain custom upgrade.
- If multiple palettes are added to the same image, only the *last* one will apply. It can still 
    fall through to earlier ones if the condition on the later ones aren't met.
- If elemental palettes are turned off in the options, it'll still read from the neutral palette you
    assigned, unless "revertIfOff" is enabled for that file.
- You can make a palette file that's just 2 lines if you don't want it to be based on element at all.
