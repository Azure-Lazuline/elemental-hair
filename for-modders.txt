This system is pretty easy to extend for your own custom characters, or to palette-swap other things.
I included "xpc-elemental-hair-example.zip" which shows the code and assets needed for it.
It applies the elemental hair palette to Triblader-Lea in the XPC mod, and should be somewhat
self-explanatory. There's also a few different ways to make the recolor only apply conditionally,
only to certain characters or when certain conditions are met. Check the main function in
prestart.js for details.

You can make a palette file that's just 2 lines if you don't want it to be based on element at all.
It'll just replace the first line of colors with the second unconditionally.
