If you want to modify this for your own custom palettes, you can just change the palette files in
assets/media/element-hair. The first line is reference colors, and the next 5 lines are for neutral,
heat, cold, shock, and wave. (You can also make it be just two lines, for unconditional recoloring.)

Check the psd files for easy gradient editing and to see it applied to the sprites as you go!
You can add more files to be recolored at the bottom of postload.js.

I've included boki-colors.zip as an example mod for if you don't want to overwrite this mod's files.
Just extract it into your mods folder. It replaces Lea's colors with Boki's from Copy Kitty, based 
on a few of the weapon palettes there. It also adds a little extra thing somewhere...
