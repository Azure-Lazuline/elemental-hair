If you want to modify this for your own custom palettes, you can just change the palette files in
assets/media/element-hair. The first line is reference colors, and the next 5 lines are for neutral,
heat, cold, shock, and wave.

Some files have 5 more lines; those are the five palettes for if you have "hair+armor" selected
instead of just hair. You can trim it down to just the normal set if you want, or make it be 2
lines and it'll replace the first with the second unconditionally (not based on element at all).
You can check the psd files for easy gradient editing and to see it applied to the sprites as you go!

I've included boki-colors.zip as an example mod for if you don't want to overwrite this mod's files.
Just extract it into your mods folder. It replaces Lea's colors with Boki's from Copy Kitty, based 
on a few of the weapon palettes there. It also adds a little extra thing somewhere...
