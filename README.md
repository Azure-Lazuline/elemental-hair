Makes Lea much more stylish by giving her different hair colors when you switch elements. If you have the [Party Element Effects](https://github.com/XenonA7/party-element-effects) mod installed then this can apply to party members and PVP opponents too.

There's a few toggles in the options menu (under "Video"), like automatically swapping back to neutral when a cutscene starts.

### Customization

If you want to modify this for your own custom palettes, you can just change the palette files in `assets/media/element-hair`. Check `customization-stuff.txt` for details.

I've included **boki-colors.zip** as an example mod for if you don't want to overwrite this mod's files. Just extract it into your mods folder. It replaces Lea's colors with Boki's from Copy Kitty, based on a few of the weapon palettes there. It also adds a little extra thing somewhere...

This system is pretty easy to extend for your own custom characters, or to palette-swap other things. Check `for-modders.txt` for details.

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader), and go to the "Mods" menu ingame (the button at the *top* of the Options menu, not the tab on the right) and it should be listed there to select and install. You should grab "Party Element Effects" there too.

You can also install manually by placing [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/elemental-hair/releases) in your ccloader mods folder.
