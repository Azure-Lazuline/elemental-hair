Fixes the greatest flaw in CrossCode by giving Lea different hair colors when you switch elements. You can apply it everywhere, or just to gameplay sprites (leaving cutscene portraits unaffected).

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader), and go to the "Mods" menu ingame (the button at the *top* of the Options menu, not the tab on the right) and it should be listed there to select and install.

You can also install manually by placing [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/elemental-hair/releases) in your ccloader mods folder.
